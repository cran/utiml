\title{Subset Correction of a predicted result}
\usage{
subset_correction(mlresult, train_y, probability = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mlresult}{An object of mlresult that contain the scores and bipartition
values.}

\item{train_y}{A matrix/data.frame with all labels values of the training
dataset or a mldr train dataset.}

\item{probability}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE} the predicted values are
the score between 0 and 1, otherwise the values are bipartition 0 or 1.
(Default: \code{FALSE})}
}
\value{
A new mlresult where all results are present in the training
 labelsets.
}
\description{
This method restrict a multi-label learner to predict only label combinations
whose existence is present in the (training) data. To this all labelsets
that are predicted but are not found on training data is replaced by the most
similar labelset.
}
\details{
If the most simillar is not unique, those label combinations with higher
frequency in the training data are preferred. The Hamming loss distance is
used to determine the difference between the labelsets.
}
\note{
The original paper describes a method to create only bipartitions
 result, but we adapeted the method to change the scores. Based on the
 base.threshold value the scores higher than the threshold value, but must be
 lower are changed to respect this restriction. If \code{NULL} this
 correction will be ignored.
